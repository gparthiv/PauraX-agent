💡 About the Name: PauraX

Paur (पौर) → A Sanskrit word meaning citizen or urbanite, reflecting our mission to empower the people of the city.

X → Inspired by IBM watsonx, representing the exponential power of AI in civic engagement.

🎯 The Problem

In India, the tax base for public development is narrow, placing disproportionate pressure on the middle class.
PauraX addresses this by enabling all citizens to invest in hyperlocal public goods (e.g., park benches, solar lights).

💰 In return for real-currency contributions, users receive non-monetary Civic Coins → fostering civic pride, transparency, and decentralized community improvement.

✨ The Solution

PauraX consists of:

📱 WhatsApp AI Agent (this repo) → Conversational interface for reporting issues, funding projects, and earning Civic Coins.

💳 Civic Wallet (frontend) → A visual dashboard to track contributions and impact.

This backend integrates IBM watsonx.ai + Granite foundation models to understand user queries, analyze photos, and guide contributions.

🚀 Core Features

💬 Conversational AI
Powered by IBM Granite Instruct v2 on watsonx.ai → contextual chats about projects & rewards.

📸 Photo-based Issue Reporting
Users upload a civic issue photo → the agent simulates AI-powered issue detection & logging.

📍 Personalized Suggestions
Requests user location → returns nearby civic projects for investment.

💰 Simulated Investment Flow
Multi-step WhatsApp chat → select project → contribute in ₹ → get estimated Civic Coins.

🔄 Stateful Conversations
Tracks user journey across multiple steps (report → location → funding).

🗄️ Mock Database
Issues stored in db.json → simulating persistence for the hackathon prototype.
